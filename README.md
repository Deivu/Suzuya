The ShipGirl Project. Suzuya, my random Java learning project. ``(c) Kancolle for Suzuya.``

Suzuya is just a good girl tbh, 10/10 would love Suzuya.

### Configuring Suzuya
1. Download the latest jar file at our [`Github Releases`](https://github.com/Deivu/Suzuya/releases)

2. You need a config.json file on where the suzuya.jar file is

> Example config.json
```json
{
    "token": "token",
    "default_prefix": "!"
}
```
2. Make the config.json based on the example above, then put it besize suzuya.jar

3. Run the program by doing `java -jar suzuya.jar`
